# Web UI Encyclopedia Sport Cars 🏎️

The "Web UI Encyclopedia Sport Cars" project is a user interface that allows vertical navigation through various Porsche sports cars using the years on the left, similar to a navigation bar. When a year is selected, the pages scroll either up or down to display the corresponding cars.

In addition to the scrolling functionality, the interface features a button to toggle between dark and light modes to enhance the visual experience for users.

This project aims to offer an interactive experience in discovering Porsche sports cars. 🏎️🔍

## Technologies Used 🛠

The project was developed using the following technologies:
- HTML  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/html5/html5-original.svg" height="15" alt="html5 logo"  />
- CSS   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/css3/css3-original.svg" height="15" alt="css3 logo"  />
- JavaScript  <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" height="15" alt="javascript logo"  />
- jQuery.   <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/jquery/jquery-original.svg" height="15" alt="jquery logo"  />


The use of jQuery facilitated the implementation of animations and enhanced my front-end animation skills. 🌟

### Limitations

Currently, the project is not suitable for mobile devices and tablets due to the increased complexity of responsive design, requiring a significant number of CSS lines. Priority was given to developing skills in JavaScript, jQuery, and interactive design. 📱⚠️

An important observation was that working on CSS took more time than JavaScript in this context. 

## Learning Objectives

This project was an opportunity to improve the following skills:
- Developing JavaScript skills and using libraries such as jQuery.
- Designing and developing interactive interfaces. 🖥️💡
